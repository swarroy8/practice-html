                <h3><strong><em>Joyfull Art Journey </em></strong></h3>
            </header>
            <p> To my mind a picture should be something pleasant, cheerful and pretty. There are too many unpleasant things in life as it is, without creating still more of them.</p>
            <section>
                <h3> Madhubani Paintings </h3>
                <p> One of the most celebrated styles of Indian art is, Madhubani which originated in the Mithila region of Bihar as a form of wall art.This spectacular folk art style was unknown to the outside world until discovered by the British colonial William G. Archer in 1934 while inspecting the damage after the massive Bihar earthquake. Archer was amazed by the beautiful illustrations on the exposed interior walls of the houses…The beauty of Madhubani lies in its simple and evocative portrayal of culture and traditions. </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Warli Paintings </h3>
                <p> This ancient Indian art is 2500-year-old tradition. Warli paintings of the Thane and Nasik areas of Maharashtra are closely linked with nature and social rituals of the tribe. Warli paintings showcase daily activities of the local people of that community like farming, dancing, hunting, praying etc. Traditionally, women used twigs to draw lively designs with rice paste on mud walls of tribal houses to mark celebrations of harvests or weddings. Simple geometrical patterns in white against a red or yellow surface are used to depict everyday life scenes.  </p>

            <section>
                <h3> Kalamkari </h3>
                <p> This 3000-year-old organic art of hand and block printing was traditionally used for making narrative scrolls and panels. This exquisite folk art has a strong connect with Persian motifs. Kalamkari derives its name from kalam or pen and is a legacy that has been handed down from generation to generation in Andhra Pradesh. The stylised animal forms, floral motifs and mehrab designs predominant in Kalamkari paintings have also found a place in Kalamkari textiles. </p>

                <h3>  Miniature Painting </h3>
                <p> The Miniature painting style came to India with the Mughals in the 16th century and is identified as an important milestone in the history of Indian art. It developed into a distinct style with a combination of Islamic, Persian and Indian elements. The painting is done using natural stone colors on a paper-based “wasli”. Mineral colors, precious stones, conch shells, gold and silver are used in the miniatures. Fine brushwork, intricacy, detailing and stylization are the unique attributes of miniature painting. </p>

                <h3> Kerala Murals </h3>
                <p> The vibrant Kerala mural paintings are one of the world’s most famous frescos and have deep spiritual roots depicting themes of Hindu mythology, epics, the classic frolics of Krishna as well as the mystic forms of Siva and Shakti. They also recount some legendary heroes of the bygone era. This traditional art style dates to the seventh and eighth century AD and is characterised by vivacious imagery, bold strokes, and vivid colours. </p>
